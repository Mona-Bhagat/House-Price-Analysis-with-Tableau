* The data format was corrected from 'text' format to 'date' format 
* The data was checked for any errors or missing values
* The data was analysed with help of Line Chart, a Map, Bubbles, and a Treemap
* A new Dashboard was created with calendar widget which acts as main filter
* The visualizations were brought in onto this dashboard and connected with the calendar widget

# Value addition to an organization
This automation would help an organization/user in the following ways:
* The dashboard is interactive which can help a user to quickly see the trends in any month of the referenced data in the dataset 
* The widget can be updated as per requirement of the user and can be filtered per year, week for a different dataset
